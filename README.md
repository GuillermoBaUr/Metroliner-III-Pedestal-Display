This repository contains the **UI component** of a project that simulates the **Metroliner III pedestal** on a **touchscreen display**, built with a **multithreaded event-driven architecture** in **Python**.  
It is optimized for **Raspberry Pi 3** and communicates with the X-Plane flight simulator via **UDP** for real-time synchronization.

**Note:** This repository only includes the **User Interface (UI)** portion of the project. Other components are not publicly available due to restrictions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multithreaded architecture**: Separate threads for event handling and GUI rendering.
- **Event-driven framework**: Scalable and modular design for responsive interaction.
- **Touchscreen support**: Interactive UI with image-based animations.
- **UDP communication**: Real-time data exchange with the simulator.
- **Optimized for Raspberry Pi**: Lightweight and efficient for resource-constrained environments.
